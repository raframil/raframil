## Hey, you! 👋

I'm Rafael Framil (or just Raframil here on GitHub), a fullstack developer with 7 years of experience under my belt. I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and a strong focus on web development. But hey, I’m not just about the web—I’m all about exploring new technologies and pushing myself out of my comfort zone.

### 🌱 What Drives Me

I’m passionate about continuous learning. Whether it's mastering a new framework, diving into a different programming language, or even exploring new disciplines, I’m always up for the challenge. What makes me tick is the excitement of growth, both professionally and personally.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect!

If you’re looking for a curious, self-motivated, and open-minded developer who’s ready to contribute to your next big idea, I’d love to chat! Feel free to reach out, whether it's to collaborate, brainstorm, or just exchange ideas.
